# openv-vcontrold-docker Personal Edition

This repository is based on the openv-vcontrold-docker project by michelde. It has been quickly adapted to my personal requirements.

Note: This customized version was tailored specifically for my own needs and might not be useful for others.

Changes
PROMETHEUS PUSH GATEWAY Support: This version has been enhanced with support for the PROMETHEUS PUSH GATEWAY, allowing metrics to be pushed to a central Prometheus server.
